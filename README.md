# Final-Project
For my final project I built an expense tracker.

Expense tracker is a simple project developed using python which helps us to analyse our expenses by storing them in a systematic tabular form. I will use tkinter for GUI. Some of the project prerequisites are Basic concepts of Python and Tkinter.
